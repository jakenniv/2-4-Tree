# 2-4-Tree
A 2-4 tree data structure 

My partner and I created this 2-4 tree for the term project of our Java class at Cedarville University. We spent about 16 hours collaborating and writing the code, and I spent an additional 4 hours debugging some issues and completing the data structure. To our knowledge, there are no major bugs in our code. 

The only file we wrote is the TwoFourTree file with main. Our professor, Dr. Dave Gallagher, wrote all the other files.
